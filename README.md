# Google-Sheet-DB
A java based example to show how to use Google Sheet like a database from any client application.

# How to use it
Follow this (https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/java) instructions to create / download a client_secret.json file.

Once you have the json file, you can use this file to access your sheets in google drive using the gdb.jar library!

I have written a sample database application "GoogleDatabaseApp", which shows how to use this gdb.jar.

And the changes will be reflected immediately in the google sheet.

You can use gsheet.jar to directly access the shpreadsheet functions!
